Even though It's a simple project, I faced enumerous challenges, learned and improved a lot while building It.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project helped me deepen my understanding of the following:
  - Semantic HTML5: I used meaningful HTML tags to improve both the structure and accessibility of the page.
  - CSS Flexbox: Flexbox was key to making the component layout responsive and easy to center on the page.
  - Media Query: I used Media Queries In Order to make the site more responsive

This was a great exercise to solidify my understanding of responsive design principles and basic component-based design.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue improving on:
  - Advanced CSS layouts: Exploring more complex techniques such as CSS Grid and mastering Flexbox even further.
  - Accessibility: Ensuring that all my projects follow accessibility best practices.
  - Responsiveness: I want to ensure that all my future projects are 100% responsive for all screen sizes.
